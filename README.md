## Documentation

Without specifying inputs, you should run it on `pull_request` or
`pull_request_target` events and the pull request for which linked issues will
be obtained will be the pull request that triggered the action.

In other contexts you can use `repository_owner`, `repository_name` and
`pull_request` inputs to specify a pull request.

This action o does not provide a way to check if the outputted linked issues
are in other repositories than the repository where the pull request is triggered,
just outputs issue numbers.

### Inputs

All are optional.

- <a name="input-repository_owner" href="#input-repository_owner">#</a>
 <b>repository_owner</b> ⇒ Organization or user owner of the repository against
 which the pull request with linked issues to retrieve is opened.
- <a name="input-repository_name" href="#input-repository_name">#</a>
 <b>repository_name</b> ⇒ Name of the repository against which the pull request
 with linked issues to retrieve is opened.
- <a name="input-pull_request" href="#input-pull_request">#</a>
 <b>pull_request</b> ⇒ Number of the pull request to retrieve.
- <a name="input-owners" href="#input-owners">#</a> <b>owners</b> ⇒ Indicates
 if you want to retrieve linked issues owners. If `true`, the outputs
 [`opener`](#output-opener) and [`others`](#output-others) will be added.
- <a name="add_links_by_content" href="#add_links_by_content">#</a> <b>add_links_by_content</b> ⇒ Add other links to issues numbers defined in the
 body of the pull request. Specify inside a `{issue_number}` placeholder
 a content matcher for additional issues that will be linked. Multiple can be
 defined separating them by newlines. Keep in mind that the existence of the
 issues discovered by this feature is not guaranteed, it just discovers
 numbers giving the provided placeholders. If you pass
 [`owners` input](#input-owners) as `true`, you'll be able to check if not
 exist checking if are contained by [`null` output](#output-null).

### Outputs

- <a name="output-issues" href="#output-issues">#</a> <b>issues</b> ⇒ Linked
 issues for the pull request, separated by commas.

If [`owners` input](#input-owners) is `true`, the next outputs will be added:

- <a name="output-opener" href="#output-opener">#</a> <b>opener</b> ⇒ Linked
 issues that have been opened by the pull request opener.
- <a name="output-others" href="#output-others">#</a> <b>others</b> ⇒ Linked
 issues that haven't been opened by the pull request opener.

If `add_links_by_content` feature discovers issues that doesn't exists
[`owners` input](#input-owners) is `true`, their numbers will be added to the
next output:

- <a name="output-null" href="#output-null">#</a> <b>null</b> ⇒ Linked
 issues that doesn't exists, so they don't have owner.
